# Call_With_AI
This project enables real-time voice interaction with ChatGPT. A user calls, and their speech is converted to text using a voice-to-text service. The text is sent to ChatGPT for processing, and the AI-generated response is converted back to audio using a text-to-speech service. The response is then played back to the user.
